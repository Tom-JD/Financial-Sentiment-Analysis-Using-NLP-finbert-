Briefly, it is a cutting-edge NLP model, released by Jacob Devlin and his team at Google, trained to understand english, as well as numerous other langages. What separates it from earlier models is it has a superior understanding of the context of words, and this is enabled by Transformers (also a very new concept), and its bidirectionality."

Our desired purpose is for BERT to understand the sentiment of a text, specifically a financial text, and to classify sentences or blocks of text as \"positive, negative, or neutral\". Secondary training of BERT further reduces error for our task at hand, and so is definitely worth the trouble. However, given my rather limited set-up, it would take me weeks just to secondarily train BERT. Luckily, there exists once such trained model, called finbert, found here: https://github.com/ProsusAI/finBERT#:~:text=FinBERT%20is%20a%20pre%2Dtrained,it%20for%20financial%20sentiment%20classification.

        "*   I believe that the lack of PDFs with a non-neutral sentiment is the main cause for a fairly unexciting project. And for this, I believe there are two primary causes. Firstly, I used company announcements rather than actual opinionated articles (such as from Newspapers). As stated above, I was forced to do this in order to be able to backtest beyond 7 days via an open source. Secondly, I believe finbert (and other sentiment-trained BERT models) still have a long way to go until they can truly guage sentiment on the level of humans, though I am optimistic this will be achieved in the coming years, given how rapidly we have already reached an NLP model as sophisticated as BERT.\n",
        "*   I will possibly in the future attempt this but for mutliple stocks at once to build up a diverse portfolio. I would have much more faith in that showing good returns. Although the caveat of extreme sentiments (in either direction) requires further investigation. Perhaps this issue is specific to company announcements (e.g. focusing on Newspaper articles may eliminate it), perhaps a failure on the part of finbert, or perhaps it is a legitimate issue. Nonetheless, I am sure my next investigation will put this to rest.\n",
        "*   Later note: Tested code with other companies, and saw more response (one company returned finap portfolio value of 100052.20 over half a year!). Perhaps then this initial example was just unlucky in that it had very little within the company announcements that finbert could extract a non-neutral sentiment out of.\n",
